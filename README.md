Galaxy Tools created by GenOuest core facility
==============================

This repository contains some Galaxy Tools maintained and developed by the GenOuest platform.

They are available in the [main ToolShed](http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/), or for some of them on the [GenOuest ToolShed](http://toolshed.genouest.org/).
